## Getting Started

To get everything up and running, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariuswinkler/WINKLER_PRC_paper.git
cd WINKLER_PRC_paper
```

### 2. Create the Conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 3. Activate the environment

```bash
conda activate WINKLER_PRC_paper
```

### 4. Register the environment as a Jupyter kernel

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=WINKLER_PRC_paper --display-name "Python (WINKLER_PRC_paper)"
```

---

## Running the Notebooks

You can run each notebook individually, or use the `main.sh` script in the `scripts/` directory to automate and manage execution â€” either locally or via SLURM.

### Script: `main.sh`

This script allows for flexible configuration, including cluster submission via SLURM or local execution.

#### Usage

```bash
./main.sh --figures=2,3 --mode=slurm --phase=compute [--debug]
./main.sh --figures=2,3 --mode=local --phase=plotting [--debug]
```

#### ðŸ›  Options

| Option           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--figures=...`  | Comma-separated list of figure numbers to generate                          |
| `--mode=...`     | Execution mode: `local` or `slurm`                                          |
| `--phase=...`    | Workflow phase: `compute` (raw processing) or `plotting` (final figure gen) |
| `--env=...`      | (Optional) Specify a custom conda environment                               |
| `--debug`        | (Optional) Print commands instead of executing them                         |

#### Notes

- For **Figures 5â€“7**, a *sigma sweep* is performed, and each sigma value is handled in a separate job.
- The sweep is executed only once, even if multiple figures (5â€“7) are selected at the same time.
